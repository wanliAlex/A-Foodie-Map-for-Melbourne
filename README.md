## Why do I create this repository?


> The reason that I am creating this repository is that my Romanian tennis coach asked to recommend some Chinese restaurants in Melbourne one day. So I think it might be a good idea to use this repo to share the good restaurants (not only Chinese but mainly Chinese food) that I know in Melbourne.


## Who am I?
> I am currently a Ph.D. student in [The University Of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). I was born in [Nanchang, Jiangxi, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanchang) and stayed in my hometown before 18-years-old. Then I went to [Chengdu, Sichuan, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu) and studied in [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn) for 4 years. I came to Melbourne for my master's degree since July 2016 and have staying here since then. I also stayed in [Shenzhen, Guangdong, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen) between August and November in 2018 when I was waitintg for my Ph.D. application result.
> I am currently a Ph.D student in [The University Of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). After living in [Sichuan Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan) for 18 years, I came to [Shaanxi Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi) and [Guangdong Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong) to finished my Bachelar and Master degrees.

## What kind of food do I like?
> If you know a litle bit about Chinse food, you wouldn't be surprised that I had been only eating spicy food before I came to Melbourne. While Chengdu is famous for its spicy Sichuan cuisine (rigorously speaking, Sichuan cuisine is far more than spicy food) , my hometown is even a bigger fan of using chili peppers. It is not an exaggeration to say that I had never had non-spicy food before 22-years-old. 
> 
> After I came to Melbourne in 2016, the large number of Cantonese restaurants and the fact that my roommate comes from the North part of China gave me a chance to try different types of Chinese food. Of course, I also tried a lot of restaurants other than Chinese ones, including Korean, Japanese, Italian, Greek and so on.

> Up to now, I would say I have a broader palate in food. But I have to say that palate is a very personalized thing and if I do not include the food you like in this foodie map accidentally, feel free to submit your pull request and share your favorite food to everyone :)

## How do I rate the restaurant?
> I will not give a quantified rate like 1 to 5 for the restaurants because it is really hard to quantify a flavor. If you want to know how much I like these restaurants, I would say I prefer to drive an hour to these restaurants than to go to the restaurant in 5 minutes walk distance.
