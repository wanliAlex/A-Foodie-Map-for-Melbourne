## [Universal Restaurant](https://www.universalrestaurant.com.au/)
>__Category__: Italian food

>__Recommendation Reasons__: As they claimed, this might be the best restaurant in Melbourne. It is located on the Lygon Street which is synonymous with the Italian community of Melbourne. The price is not high but the food is good. This restaurant is also recommended by my Italian co-supervisor.


>__Recommended Cuisines__: Milano pasta, tuscan chicken, chicken schinitzel, the universal platter. (I personally prefer American pizza so I don't make any recommendation here)

>__Personal Notes__: They don't accept any booking. So arrive the restaurant before 5:30pm if you don't like to wait. One thing that I am not satisfied is that they remove the chicken schinitzel from the delivery menu :(

## [丰衣粥食 (Wu Mi Zhou)](https://www.zomato.com/melbourne/wu-mi-zhou-cbd/photos)
>__Category__: Cantonese food, hotpot

>__Recommendation Reasons__: They provide different types of [顺德（Shunde)](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E9%A0%86%E5%BE%B7%E8%8F%9C) food. They care about the freshness and an umani taste of food. They have a specifial type of hotpot that uses the rice porridge to boil food. 

>__Recommended Cuisines__: the chicken and abalone hotpot, double skin milk

>__Personal Notes__: When I was in Shenzhen, I had a foodie travel around Shunde and ate as much food as I can. I would say this restaurant reminds me of the beautiful memory. I personally really recommend this restaurant if you have never had Shunde food or rice porridge hotpot before.

## [寻鱼炭烤 (Roast Fish Bar)](https://roastfishbar.com.au/)
>__Category__: Chinese food, Sichuan food, roast fish

## [锦州御烧烤（Jinzhou BBQ）](https://www.zomato.com/melbourne/jinzhou-bbq-1-cbd)
>__Category__: Chinese food, Northeast food, Charcoal BBQ

>__Recommendation Reasons__: BBQ in Northeast of China is very popular and this is the best one in Melbourne.

>__Recommended Cuisines__: almost all the kebab in the menu; Chinese chives pancake

>__Personal Notes__: Recommended book through phone in advance, because there are only 7 tables. The service is not good and the waiting time is long(because they roasted food by Charcoal). BBQ in China varies in different province.
